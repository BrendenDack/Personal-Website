            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
              Hello! I'm Brenden Dack, a senior Computer Engineering student at California State University, Fullerton, graduating in May 2025 with a minor in Computer Science. My focus is embedded systems, where I bridge the gap between software and hardware to build efficient, real-time solutions. I've worked on exciting projects including a 3D audio player using the Raspberry Pi and real-time monitoring systems using FPGAs.
            </p>
            <p>
              I have professional experience as a Pro Audio Intern at QSC, where I worked with circuit board-level repairs and diagnostics, and as an IT Helpdesk Intern at Fluidmaster, focusing on system setups and network infrastructure. My technical toolbox includes programming languages like C/C++, Python, SQL, and JavaScript, as well as hands-on tools like soldering irons, oscilloscopes, and multimeters.
            </p>
            <p>
              Outside of class and work, I enjoy exploring new technologies in my home lab, mentoring peers in CS/CE subjects, and diving into audio-related projects that merge creativity and engineering. I am also an active member of Tau Beta Pi, the international engineering honors society.
            </p>
